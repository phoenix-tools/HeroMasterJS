A JS class that enhances the https://stephero.io/ UX experience while offering an edge in battle. 

HeroMasterJS is open source, but access to the API requires a `.01` BNB tip to the development team every 40 days.  

If you're wanting to just try it out, there is a 14 day free trial, no tip required. 


## Features

* Prominently displays the current user's BNB balance as well as its converted values in USD and HERO

## How to Install in Chrome

Install a Chrome extension that will allow custom JS & CSS codefor websites. I recommend this extension but if anyone knows better ones I'm happy to add them to the list:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld?hl=en

Access this file and view the raw version of the code:
https://github.com/phoenix-tools/HeroMasterJS/blob/master/HeroMasterJS.js

Navigate to https://stephero.io/

Open the newly installed Chrome Extension's Custom CSS and JS extension

And click "add new" to create a new custom JS/CSS profile for the stephero.io website

Add the raw code that was copied earlier into the JavaScript panel, and save the profile.

And that's it! The next time you access https://stephero.io/ the JavaScript code should be loaded and HeroMasterJS operating. 

If you have any trouble installing please reach out to @atwellpub the Discord and I'll help asap.

Happy Baking!
